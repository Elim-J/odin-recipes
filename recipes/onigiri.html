    <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups Water</li>
        <li>1 Cup Jasmine Rice</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1 Sheet Nori (Dry Seaweed), cut into 1-inch strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="title">Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 2 cups water, rice, and a pinch of salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking, until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Fluff with a fork; cool rice until easily handled, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a small bowl with water. Place 2 tablespoons of salt in another small bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip hands in water and rub salt over hands. Take a handful of warm rice and form it into a ball; gently squish with your hands into an "L" or "C" shape, then apply gentle pressure to the sides to shape it into a triangle.</li>
        <li>Wrap a strip of nori around the triangle, using a bit of water to help it stick if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
