    <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour (I use Bob’s Red Mill)</li>
        <li>Cream cheese</li>
        <li>Large egg</li>
        <li>Cool whip – optional for extra flavor</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Fine salt</li>
        <li>Grapeseed oil to fry (vegetable ok too)</li>
        <li>2 cups Farmer's Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="title">Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure 2 cups of farmer’s cheese by crumbling cheese by hands and lightly placing into a measuring cup (don’t try to pack it). Transfer cheese into a medium bowl and break any bigger pieces with fork. Add 2 oz cream cheese, 4 tbsps cool whip, 1/4 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg; mix it/break it with fork and then finish with spatula until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate small bowl, combine and whisk together: 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt. Add dry ingredients to cheese and with help of spatula, stir together until everything is fully combined. Batter will be sticky, but not runny (if too runny, add 1-2 tbsps flour).</li>
        <li>Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-low heat and drizzle about 2-3 tbsps oil. While pan is heating, use a small ice cream scoop to make small cheese balls and place onto a cutting board covered with a plastic food wrap. Once pan is heated, flatten each cheese ball on your palm to about 1/2″ thickness and place onto the pan (if batter starts sticking to hands, dip hands into flour or wipe with oil). Saute in hot oil over medium-low heat about 2-3 mins per side. Flip over when starting to golden on bottom-side edges. Transfer to a platter and serve warm with your favorite topping such as sour cream, jam and fresh fruits, with a glass of an orange juice or milk. Enjoy!</li>
